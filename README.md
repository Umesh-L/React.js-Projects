<h1> React.js Project Codes </h1> <br/>
This repository contains the React projects that I have worked on during my journey in learning React.js library of JavaScript.<br/><br/>

The projects that are in this repo are: <br/>
1) Color Picker using react (using useState hook) <br/>

3) Digital Clock using react (useEffect hook) <br/>
4) Interactve form using react (onChange method) <br/>
5) List of car objects <br/>
6) Profile card using react <br/>

<br/>

To run the code: <br/>
-- You should have node.js(npm) installed in your system. <br/>
-- Navigate to any one of the folder and open(clone/fork) it in the code editor(VS Code). <br/>
-- In the Terminal(Command Prompt): <br/>
  -- Run "cd my-react-app" <br/>
  -- Run "npm run dev" <br/>
